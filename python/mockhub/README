	MOCK a HUB
--------------------

This is the initial release of a HUB emulator

release date: 10/08/2013

Accept a configuration ID and a report interval, so that the configuration
will be downloaded from server, and report to the server in so many interval
seconds.

Requires:
a config_id.data file in the current directory. It can have as many line as you like, so long as you do not use an integer for a float data item, verse visa.
Otherwise, the reported value will be off limit.

Example:

./mockhub.py 4019 300

This will download config 4019 from the server (defined in mcomm_defs.py,
choose the one you want to use there), and read in the data from 4019.data,
then send to the server every 300 seconds. You can change the file during the
interval, so the updated values will be sent.
